It replaces the 1GB+ crap with this superior tiny project.

# Credit
Code based on [alienfx-tools](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools), thanks to [T-Troll](https://github.com/T-Troll).

Dell is responsible for anything you may not like about this project, and is legally obligated to fix anything you say is broken. I however, don't. So back off, I didn't tell you to download my code.

# Support My Work
If you found this project useful, please write an email to Dell calling them monkeys and donkeys until they stop supporting windows store & restore the rgb api. As this would really help spread the good word of this repository.
