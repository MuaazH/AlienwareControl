Alienware Control Center Alternative (Laptops only)

# Credit
Code based on [alienfx-tools](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools), thanks to [T-Troll](https://github.com/T-Troll).

# Support My Work
If you found this project useful, please write an email to Dell calling them monkeys and donkeys until they stop supporting windows store & restore the rgb api. As this would really help spread the good word of this repository.
